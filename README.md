# Coursework proposal/ outline
This is a student project, please do not fork it I am only making it public for sharing with teachers and "stakeholders" not for collaboration or to facillitate plagerism


An online poker game where users have the opportunity to either host or join a public game using python's socket api, the game would be aimed at young people who are worried about predatory online gambling monetization and would provide a safe non profit environment for them to practice. 

 

Potential shareholders â€“ anyone at school with interest, Felix has shown signs of interest 

 

Objectives: 

 

    secure logons sent over a network, 

    A game browser 

    easy game hosting. 

    The ability to actually play the game 

    Statistics viewer 

    See past game results 

    An intuitive ui 

    The ability to play the game 

 

Aspirational targets 

 

    An offline single player opponent(ai) 

    Live win percentages 

    Scheduled "tournament games" that have are more competitive and are hosted at a set time 

    A replay mode 

 

Already done: 

    The main loop of the game 

    The start of a write up with screenshots and access to old versions via git for screenshots etc 

    The basics network connection to a central server with a server browser in development and coming very soon 

 

Next tasks: 

    Make the main loop actually ask other people via networking rather than local console inputs and a basic server browser for testing 

    Statistics recorder 

    Better client side handling to make non ui test viable 

    Complete server browser 

    User interface 

    Aspirational targets or more write up work time dependant 


Note: the reason for recent inactivity is time spent learning python's socket api in test files etc
